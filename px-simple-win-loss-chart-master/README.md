## Overview

px-simple-win-loss-chart is a Predix UI component.

Use this component to visualize a series of positive & negative values as a bar chart. The series is represented by a sequence of horizontally aligned rectangle bars, the height of each proportionally representing a value.

Positive values are represented above the x-axis in one color, and negative values are displayed below the axis, in a different color - these two colors are configurable. The width and height of the component are also configurable, or can be set to "auto" for a responsive layout.

1. node.js
2. npm
3. bower
4. [webcomponents-lite.js polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs)

## Documentation

Read the full API and view the demo [here](https://predixdev.github.io/px-simple-win-loss-chart/).

The documentation in this repository is supplemental to the official Predix documentation, which is continuously updated and maintained by the Predix documentation team. Go to [http://predix.io](http://predix.io)  to see the official Predix documentation.

## Local Development

From the component's directory...

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp sass
```

From the component's directory, to start a local server run:

```
$ gulp serve
```

The root of that server (e.g. http://localhost:8080/) will automatically open in your default browser with the API documentation page and interactive working examples.

`gulp serve` also runs `gulp watch` concurrently so that when you make a change to your source files and save them, your preview will be updated in any browsers you have opened and turned on in LiveReload.
